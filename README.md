This is a demo web app to show predatory pricing strategy in a market to root out competition is not good for the consumers in the long run. The UI components are made while keeping the [2020 Indian agricuture acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Indian_agriculture_acts) in mind but the economic models are generic and can be applied to other markets too.


## Context
Farmers in India are demandind abolition of 3 laws which opens up the agricultural market for private players with no minimum price and no restrictions on hoarding. They believe without proper safeguards, these laws will be deterimental to their economic well-being. One of their main concerns is that private players wil indulge in predatory pricing to create monopolies and root out competition.
